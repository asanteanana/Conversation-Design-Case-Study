# Conversation-Design-Case-Study
Improving AI Reliability Through Intent Mapping, Tone Control, and Safety-Aware Microcopy

1. Project Overview

This case study demonstrates how I design conversation flows that are:

Accurate

Safety-aware

User-centered

Technically grounded

Privacy-respectful

The goal was to create a repeatable, scalable system a model can follow to respond to ambiguous user messages without hallucination or overreach.
